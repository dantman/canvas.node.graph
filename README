canvas.node.graph is a JavaScript language port of the python NodeBox Graph library by Tom De Smedt.

The NodeBox Graph library includes algorithms from the python NetworkX library for
betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality, Connelly Barnes' implementation of
Dijksta shortest paths and the spring layout for JavaScript by Aslak Hellesoy 
and Dave Hoover. So likewise this JavaScript port does as well (cept the
implementations are ports of the originals like the library is).

Generally canvas.node works the same as NodeBox Graph, and uses an almost identical
api to make use of it. Parts of the code structure of course are different as
JavaScript has a different structure than python and different practices.

canvas.node is dual-licensed under the MIT and GPL version 2 or later licenses
to promote flexible re-use and openness. We're on github so feel free to use
github's fork feature to let you add features to the code and submit them back
to the project using pull requests.
